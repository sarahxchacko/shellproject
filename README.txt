Files: 
  proj1code.c = the C code
  README.txt = the readme file with all necessary info

Compilation & Running:
  Use this compilation line: gcc -std=c99 proj1code.c -o proj1code
  Execute the file using this line: ./proj1code

  To compile and run this project, we used Powershell and created the C 
  code directly in our directory using the following cat command:
      cat > proj1code.c

  After creating the file using the above command, we wrote our code and 
  hit Ctrl+D when we were done. To implement this you can just copy and 
  paste our code after entering the cat command.
